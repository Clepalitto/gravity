# Gravity
A small c++ program to calculate physics formulae.

## How to use *Gravity*
First, you need a **C++ compiler**, such as *GCC* or *Clang*, which you can find on [the official website of the C++ programing language](https://isocpp.org/get-started).
Then, you just need to build and run the file *main.cpp*
